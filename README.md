#Challenge Guidelines#
The First Challenge is to make a Broken Calculator! 

This is a twist on the normal calculator app, in that your calculator is required to â€˜malfunctionâ€™ in some way.  It could be that each time you press a button it gets stuck and canâ€™t be pressed a second time, or that all answers are 1 more than the correct answer, or maybe the whole machine turns into a demonic monster after you press too many buttons. The possibilities are endless, and the great part is that if you mess up you can say itâ€™s intentional ðŸ¤£ â€”But do try to make the intended misbehavior explicit, with some type of introduction so that a person viewing the site without a heads up will understand that yes, it is broken on purpose.

Featuring only 1 person per component (ie. html, css, js)
